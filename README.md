# lowculator, a limited calculator
The principle of the design is to imitate natural math language as possible.
+Surport almost all unary math functions in standard library. Call them just like "sin(pi/sqrt 4)"
+Add space or tabs wherever you like.
+Be free to use +-*/()^, the last of which is highest-ranked and right-associative

You can launch the program with no commandline expression, and enter the expressions laterly.
>./lowculator
>EXPRESSION1 

Or you can also launch the program with several commandline expressions. The program will calculate them one by one
>./lowculator EXPRESSION1 EXPRESSION2
